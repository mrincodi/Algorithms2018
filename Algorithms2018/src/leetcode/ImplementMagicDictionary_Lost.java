// I did this one with an ArrayList. Not difficult to do at all this way,
// but the interesting way to do it, is with a trie. I have done
// the regular word search with a trie before, so the adaptation
// shouldn't be too difficult.
// I lost the code as the laptop crashed without me saving. Just 
// putting this filename for the records.
